[[https://www.doxygen.nl/][Doxygen]] is set-up for code-documentation generation. To build the docs:

#+begin_src bash
  cmake -S . -B build -DLNA_BUILD_DOCS=ON
  cmake --build build --target docs
#+end_src

The default variables are very strict so after building just check for
the keyword "undocumented" on the output the above commands to find
undocumented code.

Make sure to have a good LSP set-up to easilly navigate between
prototypes (definitions) and implementations.

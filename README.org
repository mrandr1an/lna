#+TITLE: LnA
#+SUBTITLE: Linear Algebra for every machine

* Description
LnA (Linear Algebra) is a library that implements various mathematical operations
designed for but not limited to, machine learning models. It's design
aims to:

- Compile && Run in constrained devices. 
- Adhere by the C11 standard so as many devices as possible support it.
- Be easilly generatable as raw C by an external ml-compiler.

* Usage

** Running Examples
To compile and run examples on desktop:
#+begin_src bash
  cmake -S . -B build -DLNA_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON
  cmake --build build
  ./build/examples/$(EXAMPLE)
#+end_src
** Running Tests
To compile and run tests on desktop:
#+begin_src bash
  cmake -S . -B build -DLNA_BUILD_TESTS=ON
  cmake --build build
  ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
#+end_src
** Running benchmarks
To compile and run benchmarks on desktop:
#+begin_src bash
  cmake -S . -B build -DBUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON
  cmake --build build --target $(BENCH)
  ./build/bench/$(BENCH)
#+end_src
